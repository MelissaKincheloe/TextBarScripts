# TextBarScripts

This is a collection of TextBar scripts that I use on my system. I will be adding more as I write them, so come back often and see what there is.

The current scripts are:

## todoNotePlan

This script displays the current days todo items in the [NotePlan](http://noteplan.co/) program for the macOS. The items are color coded based on the tags for the todo. You can edit the colors by editing the script.

This is a port of the same script for [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/).
