# TextBarScripts

This is a collection of TextBar scripts that I use on my system. I will be adding more as I write them, so come back often and see what there is.

The current scripts are:

## todoNotePlan

This script displays the current days todo items in the [NotePlan](http://noteplan.co/) program for the macOS. The items are color coded based on the tags for the todo. You can edit the colors by editing the script.

This script complements the [Alfred NotePlan Workflow](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/Alfred%203/NotePlanWorkflow.alfredworkflow) in my [GitHub Alfred repository](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred)

This is a port of the same script for [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/).

## todoTaskPaper

This script displays the current days todo item in the [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) program for the macOS. The items are color coded based on the tags for the todos. You can edit the colors by editing the script. You have to set the file location of the **TaskPaper** file you want to use.

This script complements the [Alfred ToDo Workflow](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/Alfred%203/TodoWorkflow.alfredworkflow) in my [GitHub Alfred repository](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred)

This is a port of the same script for [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/).
